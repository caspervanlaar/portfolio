        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Casper David van Laar, an interdisciplinary student with a strong focus on the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and consciousness studies. 
            My academic journey, from a Bachelor’s in Sport Science at HAN University in the Netherlands to a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Wolverhampton, 
            and a two year intership in a experimental and behavioural neuroscience lab has equipped me with a unique blend of skills in both cognitive science and computational modeling.
            This foundation allows me to explore the complex relationships between brain function, behavior, and machine learning.

            My current research revolves around EEG signal analysis and the development of machine learning algorithms for neural data classification. 
            I’m particularly interested in understanding brain activity during behavioral tasks, as well as the neurophysiological underpinnings 
            of consciousness and decision-making. To advance this understanding, I’ve been working on building machine learning pipelines 
            capable of integrating electrophysiological data, such as EEG and Neuropixels recordings, with behavioral insights. Recently, 
            I developed a wavenet model that achieves high accuracy in classifying trauma severity based on EEG bands, biometric data, 
            and phenotype indicators—a step forward in bridging AI with clinical and behavioral neuroscience.

            In addition to my research, I’m deeply committed to interdisciplinary exploration. 
            I’m drawn to areas like theoretical physics and philosophy of mind, and I aspire to integrate AI, neuroscience, and mathematics to tackle fundamental questions about consciousness. 
            At the moment I am studying remotely from Australia and I’m eager to build collaborations in the neuroscience community 
            and contribute meaningfully to the field. 
            Ultimately, I aim to push the boundaries of AI and neuroscience to deepen our understanding of the mind.</p>
