      <h3>Erasmus MC - Neuroscience Department</h3>
      <p><strong>Intern</strong></p>
      <p>
        During my internship at Erasmus MC in the Neuroscience Department, <br>
        I focused on decoding electrophysiological data from deep cerebral nuclei <br>
        and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to explore neural mechanisms <br>
        underlying behavior and motor control. A significant portion of my work <br>
        involved using advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the data <br>
        obtained from these regions of the brain, ultimately contributing to our <br>
        understanding of how the brain coordinates complex behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I developed and implemented data analysis pipelines, which allowed for <br>
        better visualization and interpretation of neural activity. Specifically, <br>
        I conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on mPFC neurons during <br>
        eyeblink conditioning tasks, aiming to identify and characterize the <br>
        dynamics of neural populations during behavioral learning. Additionally, <br>
        I worked on improving that pipeline with Demixed Principal Component <br>
        Analysis (DPCA) to assess neuronal activity in the deep cerebellum and <br>
        mPFC during a time-differentiating animal model experiment, which was <br>
        designed to enhance our ability to interpret neural responses.
