    <p>I’m currently at the early stages of my master thesis, developing a hybrid CNN-WaveNet model for classifying action 
      potentials from Neuropixels recordings. The approach uses a Kilosort-inspired preprocessing pipeline 
      and integrates explainability tools to better understand model decisions. The goal is to improve spike classification 
      accuracy in noisy data and contribute to more interpretable neural decoding methods. </p>

    <p>Developed an advanced neural networks called wavenet to classify EEG signals, achieving high accuracy. Stay tuned for the publication.</p>

  <h3>Trauma severity classifier</h3>
  <div class="project-content">
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/8sG8G0b/eq.png" alt="eq" border="0"></a>
    <p>I have worked on a project to classify trauma severity using EEG and other physiological data. Using LASSO - and random forrest regression.
        The goal of this project was not getting a the best model.  Since there are better classifying techniques for that.
        But to sharpen my mathematical understanding of regression and classifying techniques. </p>

  <p>This project explored whether EEG signals can predict how well subjects understand educational videos. 
      Using 14-channel EEG data and self-reported comprehension scores, I applied both supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
      Support Vector Machines achieved up to 88.66% balanced accuracy. PCA and K-Means revealed underlying patterns 
      linked to comprehension. The findings highlight EEG’s potential for adaptive learning systems and real-time cognitive monitoring. </p>

  <p>What started as a passion project quickly turned into a growing community. 
    I founded the Dutch Brazilian Jiu Jitsu League to bring more structure and consistency to local BJJ competitions. 
    Running the league taught me a lot about organizing events, managing logistics, getting sponsors and
    building something from the ground up. 
    It was one of the most rewarding things I did outside of academia — driven by a love for the sport and the desire to give back.
  The league is currently paused, as I moved to Australia </p>
