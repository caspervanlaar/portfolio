            <p>I’m working on a project to classify trauma severity using EEG and other physiological data, with a dataset of 3,600 patients and 14 variables. I’ve optimized the model using a RandomForestRegressor. For me the goal of this project is not getting a super accurate model. 
                Since there are better classyfing techinques for that. But to sharpen my mathematical understanding of simple 
                regrssion and classyfing techinques.

            <p> I'm also at the beginning of the development of a spike sorting classifiers for long recordings with 
                multi electrodes (neuropixel) recordings. <p.
