      <h3>Research Experience Highlight</h3>
      <p>
        I developed and implemented data analysis pipelines to enhance visualization and interpretation of neural activity. Specifically, I conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on mPFC neurons during eyeblink conditioning tasks to characterize neural population dynamics during behavioral learning. Additionally, I improved this pipeline with Demixed Principal Component Analysis (dPCA) to assess neuronal activity in the deep cerebellum and mPFC during a time-differentiating animal model experiment, enhancing our ability to interpret complex neural responses.
