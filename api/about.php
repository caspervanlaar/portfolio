        I enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrYlL6vO93Q/">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a>, reading 
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177170325-casper-david"> science fiction and non fiction books </a>.

    I’m Casper van Laar, a neuroscience‑driven AI researcher. My passion lies at the intersection of neural data, machine learning, and the quest to understand how brains encode cognition, perception, 
             and behaviour.  
    I build analysis pipelines and deep‑learning models to decode complex electrophysiological data (EEG, Neuropixels) 
             and explore neural dynamics underlying decision‑making, learning, and conscious processes.

    Over the years I’ve worked on projects ranging from raw‑signal EEG classification with WaveNet models, to spike sorting and region‑identification from Neuropixels recordings, 
      and decoding cognitive states with EEG-based predictors. I combine classical signal‑processing techniques with modern neural network architectures,
      always with an eye on interpretability and methodological clarity.  
    My technical toolkit includes spike and waveform extraction, custom preprocessing pipelines, statistical modeling, and deep learning (CNNs, TCNs, Transformers). 
      I aim not only for performance, but for reproducible and transparent analysis workflows.

    What drives me is more than just “better models.” I want to contribute to a broader understanding of how neural activity relates to cognition, behaviour, and conscious experience. 
      I believe that a mix of rigorous experimental neuroscience, computational modeling, and a strong mathematical foundation will be essential to approach these deep questions.  
    In the medium term, I’m interested in exploring spiking‑neural‑network models inspired by biological data, contributing to open‑source neuroscience tools, 
      and collaborating on experiments that bridge AI and real neural biology.

    Outside the lab I enjoy Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and physical training. A reminder that brains don’t exist in a vacuum. 
      Movement, coordination and embodied experience often inspire how I think about neural dynamics, learning, and plasticity.  
    If you share an interest in computational neuroscience, AI‑driven neural decoding, or experimental brain research, or want to talk math, data, or BJJ, I’m always open to collaboration or conversation.
