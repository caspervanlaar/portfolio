        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Casper David van Laar, an Msc student in computer science and AI with a strong focus on the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and consciousness studies. 
            My academic journey began as a bachelor in Sport Science at HAN University in the Netherlands to a Master’s. 
            Where I discovered my love for statistics, programming and neuroscience.
            During my last two years at the HAN I had the privilege of joining the department of neuroscience at Erasmus MC at the cerebro-cerebellar Communication lab as an intern.
            In those two years of experimental and behavioural neuroscience I was taught the ins and outs of 
            experimental neuroscience and programming data analytic pipelines. 
            Aftwards I made the decision to pursue my master degree in computer science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Wolverhampton
            This foundation allows me to explore the complex relationships between brain function and behavior with machine learning.

            My current research revolves around EEG signal analysis and the development of machine learning algorithms for neural data classification. 
            I’m particularly interested in understanding brain activity during behavioral tasks, as well as the neurophysiological underpinnings 
            of consciousness and decision-making. To advance this understanding, I’ve been working on building machine learning pipelines 
            capable of integrating electrophysiological data, such as EEG and Neuropixels recordings, with behavioral insights. Recently, 
            I developed a wavenet model that achieves high accuracy in classifying trauma severity based on EEG bands, biometric data, 
            and phenotype indicators—a step forward in bridging AI with clinical and behavioral neuroscience.

            In addition to my research, I’m deeply committed to interdisciplinary exploration. 
            I’m drawn to areas like theoretical physics and philosophy of mind, and I aspire to integrate AI, neuroscience, and mathematics to tackle fundamental questions about consciousness. 
            At the moment I am studying remotely from Australia and I’m eager to build collaborations in the neuroscience community 
            and contribute meaningfully to the field. 
            Ultimately, I aim to push the boundaries of AI and neuroscience to deepen our understanding of the mind.</p>
